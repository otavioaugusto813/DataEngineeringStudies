The full set of format codes supported varies across platforms, because Python calls the platform C library's strftime() function, and platform variations are common. To see the full set of format codes supported on your platform, consult the [`strftime(3)` documentation](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html).

The Python docs contain all the format codes that the C standard (1989 version) requires, and these work on all platforms with a standard C implementation. Note that the 1999 version of the C standard added additional format codes. These include codes for non-zero-padded numbers, that can be obtained by appending a dash (-) (UNIX) or hash (#) (Windows) after the percent (%) sign.
